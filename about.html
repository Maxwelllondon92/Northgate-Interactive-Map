	<p style="color:yellow">This map is not completed yet!</p>
	<p>By now the implemented feature are:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>8 working district</dt><dd>Only the northen inner-city district are configured to be navigated.<br>These are: Targengate, Ascalan District, Marcher District, Oakgate, Asher's Hill, Redwani District, Balder District and Crowe District.</dd>
		<dt>Working Layout</dt><dd>The layout and navigation is pretty much what I had originally in mind, but i'm open to suggestions, as long I can realize them.</dd>
		<dt>Save/Load Function</dt><dd>Since all notes, color-assignments and other data are stored in your browser, cleaning your cache will erase everything. In the 'How to Use' page is possible to download all data and reload it after a cache wipe.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Future Features</h2>
	<p>Next I'm going to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Finish all the districts and suburbs</li>
		<li>Add buildings</li>
		<li>Draw some RPG maps to move into using <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/592260/Dungeon_Painter_Studio/" target="_blank">Dungeon Painter Studio</a></li>
		<li>Write some lore</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Why an interactive map?</h2>
	<p>This interactive website was made as a tool for DM, in order to navigate such a big city map with ease.<br>
	Also, it gives more depth to the map itself, adding dedicated section for the lore and details of the city, districts, suburbs and buildings.<br>
	Even if built in HTML and working fine if uploaded online, this website was made with the idea to be downloaded and used offline.</p>
